    # grasp_depth_resolution is the discretization distance in meter used for sampling the grasp depth value.

    # A grasp motion is composed of three linear paths: approach, retreat, lift

    # We need to know the transform from the arm IK link to the grasp point. By default we define the transform manually with
    # `tcp_to_eef_mount_transform`. Alternatively, we can set this to a frame in the robot model and compute the transform
    # automatically. this is done by setting `define_tcp_by_name: true` and providing a value for `tcp_name`.

    # If we have a tool center point frame, we would set:

    # Some suction grippers can selectively enable and disable regions of suction. If you have more than one
    # region that can be selectively activated or de-activated, set those values here and moveit_grasps
    # will prioritize grasp candidates which use full suction regions rather than partial regions.
    # it will also set the suction_regions_in_contact_ variable in the grasp candidates so that you are able
    # to only enable suction on regions that are in contact with the grasp target.
    # Note that this metric assumes that suction regions are equally sized
    # ie. width = active_suction_range_x / suction_cols_count
